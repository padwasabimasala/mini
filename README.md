Mini provides a simple framework for developing Ruby apps, a simple template
to help you organize your code. Support for Rake, Autotest, Mongoid,
Datamapper, Capistrano deployments, Bundler, and simple Debian Apt dependencies
is baked in.

# Installation

Clone the project, rename it, delete the .git dir.
- git clone http://github.com/padwasabimasala/mini 
- mv mini my_project
- rm -rf my_project/.git

In the future I hope to convert this to a gem that includes a simple project 
initializer script like Rails.

Use bin/stup_component to create a new component.

More documentation and tools to come (hopefully).
